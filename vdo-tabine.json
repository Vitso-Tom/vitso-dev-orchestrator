 "synthesized_report":"# Vendor Security Research Report: Tabnine\n\n**Report Date:** January 03, 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nTabnine is an AI-powered code completion and generation platform founded in 2012-2013 by Dror Weiss and Eran Yahav [17]. The company is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel [16] and serves over 1 million users across 10,000 customers globally [18].\n\nThe company employs between 51-100 people [16] and offers AI coding assistance through various deployment models including SaaS, VPC, on-premises, and air-gapped configurations [5].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Funding & Stability\n\nTabnine has demonstrated strong financial backing with total funding ranging from $55M to $67.4M across 6 rounds from 15-18 investors [15,17,20]. The most recent Series B funding of $25M was completed on November 8, 2023, led by Telstra Ventures with participation from Atlassian Ventures and other notable investors [18,20].\n\n**Key Financial Metrics:**\n- **Total Funding:** $55M-$67.4M (sources vary)\n- **Latest Round:** $25M Series B (November 2023)\n- **2022 Revenue:** $5.8M [19]\n- **Key Investors:** Telstra Ventures, Atlassian Ventures, Elaia, Headline, Khosla Ventures [18]\n\nThe company's valuation remains undisclosed [16], but the consistent funding progression and enterprise customer adoption suggest financial stability.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Security Certifications\n\n**⚠️ VERIFICATION REQUIRED:** While Tabnine claims multiple certifications, public verification documentation is limited.\n\n### Confirmed Certifications\n- **GDPR Compliance:** Explicitly confirmed - \"Tabnine has successfully achieved compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\" [2]\n- **ISO 9001:** Listed in trust center and marketing materials [3,1]\n\n### Claimed but Unverified\n- **SOC 2 Type 2:** Widely claimed in marketing materials but \"The company doesn't publish SOC 2 Type II or ISO 27001 certificates\" [14]. Trust center lists SOC 2 but attestation access appears restricted [3]\n- **ISO/IEC 27001:** Listed in trust center [3] but third-party analysis notes \"ISO 27001 certification is not publicly verified as of late 2025\" [9]\n\n### Healthcare Compliance\n- **HIPAA:** Claims \"HIPAA alignment\" [31] but **no confirmed BAA offering**. Documentation discusses HIPAA requirements without explicitly stating Tabnine offers Business Associate Agreements [10]\n- **ITAR:** Claims \"ITAR alignment\" [31] but no verification documentation found\n\n### Additional Claims\nThird-party security profiles list multiple compliance claims including \"PCI Compliant · HIPAA Compliant · SOC 2 Compliant · GDPR Compliant · ISO 27001 Compliant · FedRamp Compliant · CSA Star Level 1 Compliant\" [12], but these require direct verification.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Data Handling & Privacy\n\nTabnine implements strong privacy controls with explicit policies:\n\n### Zero Retention Policy\n- **Code Storage:** \"We never retain any code on our servers. Requests are only ephemerally processed to provide coding suggestions and are then immediately discarded\" [5]\n- **Processing Model:** \"Context is deleted immediately after the server returns the answer to the client\" [13]\n\n### Training Data\n- **Customer Code:** \"Your code never trains our models\" and \"Tabnine NEVER retains or shares any of your code with third parties\" [13]\n- **Training Sources:** Uses only permissively licensed open-source code (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause) [30]\n\n### Third-Party Sharing\n- **API Usage:** \"No third-party APIs are used\" for proprietary models [33]\n- **Data Sharing:** Explicit policy against sharing code with third parties [13]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Security Incidents\n\n**No known security breaches or incidents** were identified in the research. Tabnine's security documentation emphasizes \"This minimizes the risk of any unauthorized access or data breaches concerning your code\" [6].\n\n### Security Practices\n- **Continuous Monitoring:** \"Our security team continuously monitors for vulnerabilities and conducts regular audits\" [6]\n- **Bug Bounty Program:** Active program encouraging security researchers to identify vulnerabilities [21]\n- **Incident Response:** Security breach notification and mitigation procedures in place [22]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Enterprise Integration\n\n### Identity Management\n- **SSO Support:** SAML SSO supported for enterprise self-hosted deployments [23]\n- **SCIM Protocol:** Supports IdP user synchronization with test/live toggle and API key configuration [24,25]\n- **Supported Providers:** Okta, Azure Entra ID, and other SCIM 2.0 providers [26]\n\n### Monitoring & Compliance\n- **Audit Logs:** Available for user and team management events [29]\n- **Usage Reporting:** Organization and team-level usage metrics with export options [25]\n- **Penetration Testing:** Reports available through trust center [34]\n\n---\n\n## 7. Cloud Infrastructure\n\n### Hosting & Compliance\n- **Cloud Providers:** AWS and Google Cloud Platform [6]\n- **Inherited Compliance:** \"AWS compliance, GCP compliance: ISO 27001, 27017, 27018, SOC1/SOC2/SOC3, PCI DSS Level 1, HIPAA, FedRAMP\" [6]\n\n### Encryption\n- **Data in Transit:** TLS 1.2 encryption for all communications [6]\n- **Data at Rest:** 256-bit AES encryption for stored data [6]\n- **End-to-End:** Industry-standard encryption algorithms throughout [6]\n\n### Deployment Options\n- **SaaS:** Standard cloud deployment\n- **VPC:** Private cloud deployment\n- **On-Premises:** Self-hosted installation\n- **Air-Gapped:** Fully disconnected deployment for maximum security [5,27]\n\n---\n\n## 8. Risk Summary for Healthcare Use\n\n### ✅ Strengths\n- Strong data privacy controls with zero retention policy\n- Multiple deployment options including air-gapped\n- No third-party API dependencies\n- GDPR compliance confirmed\n\n### ⚠️ Moderate Risks\n- **Certification Transparency:** Key certifications (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001) claimed but not publicly verifiable\n- **HIPAA BAA:** Claims HIPAA alignment but no confirmed BAA offering\n\n### 🔴 High Risks for Healthcare\n- **No Confirmed HIPAA BAA:** Critical gap for healthcare organizations handling PHI\n- **Certification Verification:** Procurement teams may require NDA attestations to access compliance documentation [26]\n\n### Recommendations for Healthcare Organizations\n1. **Request direct certification evidence** for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001\n2. **Clarify HIPAA BAA availability** before PHI exposure\n3. **Consider air-gapped deployment** for maximum data control\n4. **Validate security controls** through direct vendor engagement\n\n---\n\n## Sources Appendix\n\n[1] [Tabnine vs. Google Gemini Code Assist - Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/tabnine-vs-google-gemini-code-assist/) - Vendor Source\n\n[2] [Tabnine achieves GDPR compliance for enhanced privacy - Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/blog/tabnine-achieves-gdpr-compliance-for-enhanced-privacy/) - Vendor Source\n\n[3] [Tabnine Trust Center | Powered by SafeBase](https://trust.tabnine.com/) - Vendor Source\n\n[4] [Tabnine vs. Windsurf - Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/tabnine-vs-windsurf/) - Vendor Source\n\n[5] [Total AI code privacy & zero data retention: Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/code-privacy/) - Vendor Source\n\n[6] [Security | Tabnine Docs](https://docs.tabnine.com/main/welcome/readme/security) - Vendor Source\n\n[7] [Tabnine's private and protected Universal models | Tabnine Docs](https://docs.tabnine.com/main/welcome/readme/ai-models/tabnines-private-and-protected-universal-models) - Vendor Source\n\n[8] [Tabnine vs. Codeium - Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/tabnine-vs-codeium/) - Vendor Source\n\n[9] [7 Windsurf Alternatives with SOC2, ISO & On-Prem Security - Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/tools/7-windsurf-alternatives-with-soc2-iso-and-on-prem-security) - Third Party\n\n[10] [HIPAA cybersecurity requirements - Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/blog/hipaa-cybersecurity-requirements/) - Vendor Source\n\n[11] [Augment Code vs Tabnine: model choice, privacy, and features - Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/tools/augment-code-vs-tabnine-model-choice-privacy-and-features) - Third Party\n\n[12] [Is Tabnine Safe?
